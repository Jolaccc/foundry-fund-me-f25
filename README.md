Project Overview
The Foundry Fund Me (F23) project is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to send funds to a smart contract and allows the contract owner to withdraw funds. It integrates with Chainlink Price Feeds to fetch real-time price data and uses Foundry for development, testing, and deployment.

Key Features
Funding Mechanism: Users can send funds to the smart contract.

Withdrawal Mechanism: The contract owner can withdraw funds.

Price Feeds: Integration with Chainlink for real-time price data.

Testing: Comprehensive test suite to ensure contract functionality.

Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foundry-fund-me-f23.git
cd foundry-fund-me-f23
Install Foundry:
If you don't have Foundry installed, follow the official Foundry installation guide.

Install Dependencies:
Install the required dependencies using Foundry:

bash
Copy
forge install
Set Up Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your environment variables (e.g., private keys, API keys):

bash
Copy
touch .env
echo "PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here" >> .env
echo "INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key_here" >> .env
echo "ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here" >> .env
Usage
Compile the Contract
To compile the smart contract, run:

bash
Copy
forge build
Run Tests
To run the test suite, use:

bash
Copy
forge test
For verbose output, use:

bash
Copy
forge test -vvvv
Deploy the Contract
To deploy the contract to a local Anvil network:

bash
Copy
make deploy-anvil
To deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet:

bash
Copy
make deploy-sepolia
Interact with the Contract
You can interact with the deployed contract using Foundry's cast command or by writing custom scripts.

Testing
This project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure the smart contract functions as expected. To run the tests, use:

bash
Copy
forge test
Test Coverage
To check test coverage, run:

bash
Copy
forge coverage
Deployment
Local Deployment (Anvil)
Start Anvil:

bash
Copy
make start-anvil
Deploy the contract:

bash
Copy
make deploy-anvil
Sepolia Deployment
Deploy the contract:

bash
Copy
make deploy-sepolia
Verify the contract on Etherscan:

bash
Copy
make verify-sepolia
Verification
To verify the contract on Etherscan, use:

bash
Copy
make verify-sepolia
Ensure you have set the ETHERSCAN_API_KEY in your .env file.
